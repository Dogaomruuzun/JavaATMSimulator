# ATM Simulator
This project aims to simulate an automatic teller machine (ATM). The ATM is used by the customers of a bank. Each customer has a checking account and a savings account. Every customer is identified by a customer number and a personal identification number (PIN). The ATM provides customers with access to their accounts. Customers can select their accounts at the ATM, view the balance of the selected account, and perform deposit and withdrawal transactions. This process continues until the customer chooses to exit. We can test the ATM and bank classes using a text-based interface. The bank reads customer information from a file and locates customers. Each customer has the ability to match a customer number and PIN. The state of the ATM determines the current transaction and the text displayed to the user. After entering the customer number and PIN, the ATM locates the customer from the bank, selects the customer's account, and performs the chosen transaction.
